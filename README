# Simple PID control

This repository demonstrates a simple PID control mechanism. PID control is a control loop mechanism with feedback. Learn more on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PID_controller)

## Description

An interactive playground to interact with and learn about PID control intuitively.

There are two sliders on the page, of which one is disabled. It cannot be interacted with and it represents the process Variable (PV). The other slider which is interactable, represents the setpoint (SP). A PID controller controls the PV slider and is guided by the SP slider, which can be adjusted as desired.

## Usage

Open the [index.html](index.html) page in any web browser and tinker with the controls.

There are three input fields which set the values for the P, I and D terms. Set the values and click on Initialize button to start the PID process. Then play around with the SP slider and observe the PV slider move to match the SP slider.

To change the PID terms, press the Stop button to stop the current PID controller and then Initialize the new one with a new set of values for the PID terms.
